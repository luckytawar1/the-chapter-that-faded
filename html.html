  <h1>The Chapter That Faded</h1>

  <section>
    <p>There was a girl... not my girlfriend, not even someone I’d label clearly. I can’t reveal her name — not out of respect, but because I know some names are better left unspoken.</p>
    <p>She wasn’t someone I was in love with, but she did have a small space somewhere in the chaos of my mind. A quiet type, reserved, maybe a little moody — the kind you can’t really read easily.</p>
    <p>Our chats weren’t extraordinary, but they weren’t meaningless either. Somewhere in between casual jokes and personal thoughts, something settled — not exactly a bond, but not ignorance either.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>We started talking about random things — life, overthinking, the stupid situations school throws at us. At times, she replied late. Sometimes, she ignored my lines completely. But I got used to it.</p>
    <p>Once in a while, she'd open up — like peeling one layer from a locked box. I didn’t try too hard, because I knew if I pulled more, she'd disappear.</p>
    <p>She had her walls. I had my curiosity. She gave one-liners. I typed paragraphs. Classic imbalance, but still… it worked in its own weird way.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Time passed. Conversations got dry. Replies turned into reactions. What once felt like a vibe now started feeling like a silence wearing makeup.</p>
    <p>I never confessed anything. Neither did she. We never labeled what this was — and maybe that’s why it faded without needing to end.</p>
    <p>No big drama. No final goodbye. Just gaps… then distance… then nothing.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="fade-line"></div>

  <section>
    <p class="ending">Sometimes, people come into your life like passing clouds — they don't stay, but they do shade you for a moment.</p>
    <p class="ending">This wasn't a love story. This was just a <span class="highlight">chapter that faded</span>.</p>
